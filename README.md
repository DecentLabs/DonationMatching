**ðŸ’¸ Charity Donation Matching**

UI components and an Ethereum smart contract to support donation matching. A charity could easily embed this as a widget into their sites.

**Basic flow**
An initial donor deposits funds for the matching budget, specifies the recipient (the charity) and an expiration time for the campaign. Further donors can contribute until expiration. If the matching budget is reached, funds are transferred to the recipient. If the budget is not fully matched until expiration, remaining budget is released to initial donor, the rest is transferred to recipient.

**Future ideas**
* Find charities/donors and complete a campaign during the Hackathon
* Social media sharing features.
* Support both ETH and ERC20 donations.
* Support matching ratios other than 1:1. 
* Support multiple donors contributing to the budget (increasing the matching ratio).
* Track referrals, so donors can see the impact of their shares / promotional campaigns.
* Issue unique NFT rewards for donors.
